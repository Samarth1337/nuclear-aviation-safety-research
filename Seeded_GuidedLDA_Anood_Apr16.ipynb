      "DCPP’s extensive and thorough Root Cause Evaluation of the Loss of Power to Unit 2 4kV Bus G during refueling outage 2R17 clearly discusses in detail the roles that both Operations and Maintenance personnel played in planning for the replacement of Unit 2 Bus G potential fuse UA- 2. At the same time, the Root Causes of the Event as determined by the station focused on the inadequacies of Maintenance personnel without any mention of Operations. Although Unit 2 was shut down and defueled at that time, the Operations group nevertheless plays a key role in Unit status control. It appears that this role, on a par with that of the Maintenance organization, could have been better exercised throughout the planning, preparation, and execution phases for this maintenance activity. \n",

The examination concluded that DCPP lacked clear standards for risk assessment, risk evaluations, and risk mitigation activities that could, and did, result in SSFFs. It further concluded that, when reviewing evaluations, the station had a tendency to justify and accept the evaluations rather than to provide a healthy challenge to them. It also noted that opportunities had been missed to reinforce high standards, that resolutions of identified risks were sometimes incomplete, and that there was sometimes no means or expectation for identifying risk significant activities. A contributing cause identified by the station was that “station personnel had insufficient understanding of the definition of an SSFF, resulting in failure to recognize that adherence to station procedures and plant Technical Specification action requirements does not prevent SSFFs. \n",

      "The DCPP Fuel Handling System has been problematic since Refueling Outage 2R14. Problems have been mostly due to age-related issues and lack of adequate inspection, maintenance, and component replacement, especially electrical contacts. Interim corrective actions are to be employed until Refueling Outage 1R19, when major modifications to the system will begin; and the interim corrective actions appeared satisfactory. DCPP responded properly to the failure of the shaft seals in its Unit 1 and Unit 2 Reactor Coolant Pumps in Outages 1R18 and 2R17 respectively by replacing most seal parts and initiating a Root Cause Evaluation, and the evaluations appeared to be comprehensive and accurate. The options being examined and pursued by both DCPP and PG&E’s transmission group appear to provide satisfactory remedies to the issue of voltage fluctuations on the 230kV system. Equipment problems and failures increased the frequency of Critical Event Clock Resets in the second half of 2013. Also, equipment problems due to aging have led to an increasingly negative trend in the station’s Deficient Critical Component Backlog Orders. DCPP’s performance on reducing or eliminating Safety System Functional Failures (SSFFs) has not improved despite implementation of a corrective action plan. DCPP’s Root Cause Evaluation of Unit 2’s trip from 100 percent power following a failure on the 500kV Main Bank Transformer B phase lightning arrester is extensive and appears to be reasonable. \n",

      "A root cause evaluation was done with Mr. Bedesem serving as the lead analyst. The root cause evaluation determined that foreign material, construction or maintenance debris, from the reactor coolant drain tank got into the seal packages through the seal injection system which had not been fully flushed. DCPP has determined that it needs to do a better job of foreign material exclusion (FME) and this resolution appeared satisfactory to the DCISC team but Mr. Wardell recommended the DCISC follow up on this issue following 2R18. Dr. Peterson mentioned there has been some delay but DCPP has integrated plans to replace the seals with seals that have improved capability to limit leakage after the pump is shut down and that such low-leakage seals would be very useful under station blackout (SBO) conditions to maintain primary coolant inventory. \n",

This occurred during work on the polar crane during the last refueling outage when the same technicians were employed over a period of several days. The NRC has established work hour limitations to prevent worker fatigue and there are regulations on how many days in succession workers may work and this was an event where the technicians working on the polar crane in containment had reached their normal work limits.

In response to these four issues, the station has developed an extensive site-wide program whose apparent objective is to ensure that no mistakes will ever occur.

      "The Design Quality issue is about erroneous designs released for construction. During Refueling Outage 1R17, there were major modification designs released for implementation which had errors. The reason for the error determination was the large number of Field Changes required for the modifications to be implemented. Three design packages were issued incomplete (“managed exceptions”) due to vendor issues and late scope additions, counting on the Field Change Process (FCP) to add information to complete the packages; however, the FCP did not include the same discipline and rigor as the full Design Change Process (DCP). Approximately one-third of the FCs were required due to design errors. Adding to the problem was the fact that each of these designs was begun late and performed on a compressed time schedule.  \n",

An Apparent Cause Evaluation (ACE) was initiated in March 2013 to address the problems until major modifications are begun in Outage 1R19. The apparent cause was identified as “ . . . age-related degradation of Spent Fuel Pool bridge crane controllers exacerbated by limited margin of the current 24-Volt control systems.” The three 2R17 events all involved contacts in the 24 Volt systems, which have little margin for degraded (dirty) contacts. Other failures were due to lack of or inadequate regular inspections, maintenance (cleaning) or replacement and due to lack of a thorough understanding by operators of the infrequently used system. These problems did not adversely affect nuclear safety but mostly contributed to delays in fuel movement. \n",

      "The discovery in 2008 of a new earthquake fault just west of the plant site, the “Shoreline Fault,” has resulted in a multi-year technical effort to understand the fault and its possible effect on the plant’s ability to remain safe during a potential earthquake on that fault. The tentative conclusion of the NRC is that the plant’s current design is adequate, and the DCISC concurs. However, important technical work is ongoing to provide additional information about this fault and its potential effects. The DCISC has followed this issue from the start and will continue to do so. \n",

Some errors were found in the assembly process for Unit 2 B&C phases and for Unit 1 C phase. Some arresters showed evidence of rust/corrosion. However, for Unit 2 B phase, it was inconclusive whether the rust was introduced before or after the failure. Moreover,the other phases were subjected to and passed the manufacturer’s leak test during this forensic examination. This led to the conclusion that the only viable source of oxidation was ozone, which is a product of partial discharge in the lightning arrester during operation. \n",

      "The DCISC observed a December 7, 2021, licensed operator simulator scenario for a crew comprised of Licensed Operators the majority of whom were currently working in off-shift positions. Most of the crew's licenses were currently inactive; meaning, they did not regularly work the minimum number of on-shift hours necessary to maintain their licenses in active status. DCPP maintains a higher number of inactive Licensed Operators (approximately 20) than is typical in order to maintain a reserve pool of off-shift operators as the plant approaches the cessation of power operations. The DCISC considered this an excellent approach to reduce the risk of dropping below the required number of Licensed Operators due to unexpected operator losses. Inactive license holders were still required to participate fully in all training weeks. The simulator scenario was designed to evaluate crew performance in any or all areas and was not tied to any particular course of instruction. This scenario was similar to one which would be performed during the operating portion of a formal initial license or requalification examination. \n",

      "A significant fuel oil leak occurred on EDG 2-3 during a maintenance run in June 2021, and the EDG was shut down to repair the leak. The size of the leak was judged to have rendered the EDG unable to run for the duration of time needed in the accident analyses, and the failure was therefore classified as a Maintenance Rule Functional Failure and a Critical Equipment Clock Reset. The Cause Evaluation had not been completed as of the date of the FFT's meetings. This failure was the primary driver for the Red (Unhealthy) system health classification, and it was forecasted that the system health would return to Green (Healthy) at the end of the third quarter of 2021. \n",
