The DCISC has identified a number of potential nuclear safety issues with the use of closed cooling at DCPP. ,effective safety communication,,,,,
New regulatory requirements were not adequately translated into a specific calculation in the plant’s design basis and therefore failed to demonstrate that the 230kV preferred offsite power source had adequate capacity and capability to supply the minimum required terminal voltage to plant engineering safety features following a limiting transmission system contingency. ,leadership safety values and actions,work processes,,,,
"The DCISC learned in December 2013 that 16 impaired fire doors would not be repaired or replaced until 2017 due to funding deferrals and found this unacceptable. Following up in March 2014, the DCISC found that six doors had been repaired or replaced, and the remaining ten were the highest priority on the Plant Door Life Cycle Management Plan. ",leadership safety values and actions,personal accountability,effective safety communication,,,
"The DCPP Fuel Handling System has been problematic since Refueling Outage 2R14 (March 2009). Problems have been mostly due to age-related issues and lack of adequate inspection, maintenance, and component replacement, especially electrical contacts. ",problem identification and resolution,,,,,
"Additional efforts also need to be devoted to reducing operator burdens and workarounds as well the backlog of deficient critical components, and this requires the involvement of other station work groups besides Operations. ",personal accountability,work processes,continuous learning,,,
The loss of power to Unit 2 4kV Bus G during Refueling Outage 2R17 was avoidable and was due to a number of breakdowns in the planning and conduct of a maintenance activity during a refueling outage. ,leadership safety values and actions,work processes,,,,
"Three Station Level Human Performance Event Clock Resets occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013, causing the station’s 18-month indicator for such Resets to become Yellow (deficient). Two of these three events involved Operations personnel. Operations performance with respect to human error rate has been Red (Unsatisfactory) since July 2013. Component mispositioning appears to be a contributor. ",leadership safety values and actions,work processes,continuous learning,,,
"Equipment problems and failures increased the frequency of Critical Event Clock Resets in the second half of 2013. Also, equipment problems due to aging have led to an increasingly negative trend in the station’s Deficient Critical Component Backlog Orders. DCPP’s performance on reducing or eliminating Safety System Functional Failures (SSFFs) has not improved despite implementation of a corrective action plan.

"Leaders are not consistently setting, modeling, and reinforcing clear standards and expectations for conservative decision-making, resulting in a station culture that favors production-oriented interpretation of the license basis. ",leadership safety values and actions,work processes,continuous learning,,,
Inadequate staffing of Emergency Response Organization (ERO) personnel on shift occurred due to the fact that an operator had filled an on-shift ERO position for three consecutive shifts while the operator’s formal qualification for being able to use a self-contained oxygen breathing apparatus for respiratory protection had expired. ,leadership safety values and actions,personal accountability,environment for raising concerns,respectful work environment,questioning attitude,
"A licensing basis change on the 230kV offsite power system was not accompanied by a review for whether the change might create an unreviewed safety question, which would have required prior approval by the NRC. ",leadership safety values and actions,effective safety communication,,,,
